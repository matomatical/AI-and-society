# Artificial Intelligence and Society

This repository documents my (totally incomplete) exploration of the
philosophy of ethics and society with a particular interest in the future
role of artificial intelience. This will include both near-term and
long-term future issues.
The content is based on my reading, research, thought, coursework, 


This repository is a perpetual work in progress.
If we're lucky, one day it might become a website, or even a book (haha,
sure).
But seriously, if you want specific resources or progress or if you have
questions, just raise an issue.


## Repository guide:

* \[WIP\] Resources (below):
  A collection of resources and links related to the topics of this project.
  Includes notable readings, other reading and resource lists, etc.

* [COMP90087 The Ethics of Artificial Intelligence](comp90087/):
  Unimelb's COMP90087 is an introduction to current issues in AI and society,
  framed using introductory moral philosophy.
  I joined the teaching team in the innaugural semester (2021).
  Here you can find some information about the subject and staff, the
  official syllabus, and a complete list of *readings!*

* \[WIP\]
  [AGI Safety Fundamentals](agisf/):
  A fellowship (more of a reading group) from EA Cambridge, on research into
  the safety of generally intelligent AI systems.
  Here, find readings, and possibly some of my notes if I decide to take
  some throughout the program.
  The readings are already available online now:
  [Fellowship on AGI Fundamentals](https://www.eacambridge.org/agi-safety-fundamentals).

* \[WIP\] [My notes on ethics and AI](notes/):
  My list of key topics, lessons, and readings, and some of my remaining
  questions.




## Resources
